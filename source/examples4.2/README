Example sets in this directory were generated randomly using
the stochastic logic program interpreter in CProgol4.2. The
file generate.pl in this directory contains the Prolog source
that can be used by Progol to generate random examples. The
easiest way is to consult a file containing the target theory
together with mode declarations, together with generate.pl.
Next use testset/3 to generate a random test-set file,
containing positives and negatives. Positive only examples
can then be filtered from this file using the UNIX `grep'
command.

More information about Stochastic Logic Programs can be
found by reading ../README.
